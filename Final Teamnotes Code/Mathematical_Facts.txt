Pisano Period:

Pisano Period refers to the period with which Fibonacci numbers mod some P repeats. In other words, for some modulus P, its Pisano Period is equal to some M such that F_a mod P = F_(a mod M) mod P for all a.
for moduli of form 10^k, its 15 * 10^k

Euler Characteristics:

For a planar graph, the following identity holds:

x = V - E + F

V = verticies
E = edges
F = faces
